<h3>Welcome to HTMLHttpRequest!</h3>

<p>The content you're reading has been loaded asynchronously in the background
and inserted into a &lt;DIV&gt; in the document. You can use this script to
make any element behave as a container, loading partial HTML content and the
output of GET and POST form requests unmodified, <em>without</em> any script
in the loaded files!</p>

<h3>Build your AJAX application</h3>
<p>This script is therefore ideal for dynamically updating areas
of your page via script control or user initiation, and constructing rich
client-side web applications that send and retrieve data to/from a server.</p>

<p>It wraps up the 'XMLHttpRequest' object supported by many modern browsers
in a handy API supporting multithreaded document loading and form posting.
Additionally, it includes an additional custom-written hidden-IFRAME-based
transport layer that adds broader browser support, including IE4+ on Windows,
IE5+ on Mac, Opera 7.0 and higher, Safari, Mozilla, and more.
XMLHttpRequest by itself supports only IE5+/Windows, Mozilla, Safari 1.2+,
and Opera 8.0+.</p>
