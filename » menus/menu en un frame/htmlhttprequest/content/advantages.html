<h3>Advantages</h3>

<p>This offers some major advantages over just implementing XMLHttpRequest by itself:</p>

<ol>
 <li><strong>Browser Support:</strong> This implements both XMLHttpRequest and
  a custom-written hidden-IFRAME-based transport layer. Therefore, it works in
  a wider range of browsers, including Opera 7 and IE5/Mac.</li>
 <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> The document interface code is written
  with modern "best practice" coding standards in mind. Links are standard A
  HREF links with a CLASS attribute applied, so legacy useragents can still
  access your site's content.</li>
 <li><strong>Multithreading:</strong> The threaded RemoteFileLoader object will
  automatically create transports as needed, so you can have as many
  simultaneous requests going on in the background as you want. Plus, it's
  smart enough to reuse transports that are idle or loading into the same
  target.</li>
 <li><strong>Easy:</strong> You can load any file anywhere with just a function
  call.</li>
</ol>
