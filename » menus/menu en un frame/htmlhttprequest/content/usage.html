<h3>Usage Notes</h3>

<p>Instructions are in the source, so open it up with your favourite text editor and enjoy.
There are some important points you should know:</p>
<ol>
 <li>Only files from the same domain can be loaded, due to JavaScript browser security rules.</li>
 <li>Loaded content should be textual. If you wish to load a PDF, image, Word document, or
  similar, either embed it into an HTML document or use another script for that purpose.</li>
 <li>Loaded files should be either valid (X)HTML or
	 <a class="loadinto-targetArea" href="content/plaintext.txt">plain text</a>;
		(X)HTML documents are parsed to an XML DOM, while all documents should have their text
		content available.</li>
</ol>
